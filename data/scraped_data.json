In response to these unprecedented times, Mitacs is making short-term modifications to our operations.Please let us know which option below best meets your needs during the pandemic period:A) Off-site: Mitacs is allowing work to take place virtually during this unprecedented time. In this case, we expect interns/fellows to follow partner and academic institution work from home procedures. We expect all participants to keep in close contact with each other, agreeing on expectations, and carrying out methodologies. Please confirm if this is the case.B) Changes: We are also supporting changes to projects on a case-by-case basis. If your project is not able to continue in the current climate (e.g., indispensable infrastructure isn’t available), you can put your project on hold at any time — now or in the future. If you wish to do this, we invite the academic researchers and the partner organizations to discuss the best course of action. Please advise us of the exact or anticipated dates on which your project was/will be put on hold and when it will be resumed.C) Other: If your project can carry on as originally planned, please let us know. If you need to make other modifications, please also let us know.For more information on how to get the most out of your virtual experience, we recommend you review the Virtual Interactions Guide found in the General Mitacs Terms, Conditions and Policies zip file under How To Apply.

External reviewers for internship proposals receive the following questions to guide their assessment of the proposal: Proposals for large and long-term projects may sometimes involve significant technical or scientific uncertainties, complex project management plans, or highly structured intern recruitment, supervision, and training plans.",
        "In these situations, Mitacs reserves the right to hold a review meeting between applicants and reviewers to support the assessment of such proposals before arriving at a final funding decision. The need for such a review meeting will be determined as part of the review process, and applicants will be notified as soon as possible if a review meeting needs to be scheduled. The following steps outline the responsibilities of each Mitacs Accelerate participant before, during, and after their project. For projects with multiple internships, each intern is responsible for their individual steps.Interns travelling internationally (whether to or from Canada) may have additional or different responsibilities, which can be found on theAccelerate Internationalpage.Mitacs AccelerateTerms and Conditionsoutline participants’ responsibilities in further detail — each participant is expected to understand and adhere to the Terms and Conditions of the program.",

Recent college and university graduates (any level) are eligible, at the discretion of the academic institution. Yes. Partner organizations are welcome to contribute additional funding but Mitacs will not provide any additional funding outside of the standard award.",
        "[This additional partner funding should be included in the application budget and the anticipated use of funds (e.g., stipend/salary top-up, specialized equipment).] Top-up funds must be received at Mitacs at the same time as the minimum contribution and will be added to the award and forwarded to the academic institution. Interns are required to spend at least 50% of their internship on site with the partner organization. In exceptional circumstances, interns may spend less than half of the internship with their partner. Consult with your Business Development Specialist to determine if your project is eligible. Mitacs does not have any restrictions on its recipients holding other grants.You are responsible to determine if your other grants have such restrictions prior to applying to Accelerate. Direct interaction and supervision by the partner organization for a portion of the internship is a key feature of Mitacs’s Accelerate, BSI and Elevate programs.",
        "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mitacs required that interns spend time on site at the partner organization to benefit from this interaction and supervision. Now that the technology to enable virtual work has greatly improved and many workplaces have hybrid or fully virtual operations, Mitacs will continue to allow interaction with the partner organization in our internship programs to take place virtually as well as in person. When writing their application, participants should focus on the nature of the interaction with the partner and plan for high-quality interaction and supervision regardless of whether it takes place in person, virtually or hybrid. Mitacs still encourages on-site interaction at the partner when it is logistically feasible. * Note that Globalink and Accelerate International are international mobility programs. For this reason, travel and time spent on site with collaborators are still required in these programs.",
        "Internships are 4–6-month units of a research project, valued at $15K per unit, with $7,500 from both the partner organization and Mitacs, to support post-secondary research projects. Funds flow through the academic institution with a stipend to the student at a minimum of $10K, with up to $5K to support research costs. Please refer to the Funding section for an illustrated explanation. Mitacs cannot find partner organizations for individual interns. For tips on finding a partner organization, view theResearch Partnerships 101 webinar, talk to your academic supervisor, or visit theResearchers Wanted page. Please refer to Mitacs Conflict of Interest Policy (found in the downloadable General Mitacs Terms, Conditions & Policies zip file under How To Apply) for more details. If there is a conflict of interest, please discuss with your Mitacs Business Development representative before applying.",
        "In order to apply for Mitacs Accelerate projects, you would need both an academic partner and a non-academic partner (e.g. a partner organization such as a for-profit or not-for-profit corporation) who would also be benefiting from the research. For-profit corporations, including eligible intern-owned start-ups based at approved incubators, and eligible not-for-profit (NFP) corporations, municipalities, and hospitals can participate. Projects with an NFP, municipality or hospital partner must demonstrate an economic or productivity orientation, which must be described in the proposal and will be evaluated by the peer reviewers. Contact your Mitacs representative to verify eligibility of NFP, municipality, and hospital partners.Partners in Canada and abroad must have an office or site where the intern(s) undertakes at least 50% of the internship.If you’re not sure if a partner is eligible, contact a Mitacs representative or accelerate@mitacs.ca.",
        "Mitacs forwards Accelerate funds to the student’s academic institution only after it has received the contribution from the student’s partner organization. Please allow two weeks for processing upon receipt of this contribution. Interns travelling to Canada should be aware that their funding may not be available until they arrive in Canada. Mitacs recommends that interns contact their Canadian host institution’s Office of Research Services prior to the project to determine when they can access funds. Invoices must be paid in full to Mitacs prior to any internship funds being sent by Mitacs to the university. Please note that all partner funds must be sent directly to Mitacs and not to the university. The funds must be received in advance of the internship start date. Certain requirements must be met to be eligible to request a project extension. Please see the criteria below and contact your Mitacs Advisor for next steps.",
        "If your case does not meet the criteria below, you may submit a new project funding application. 1. Applicants who have an approved Mitacs Accelerate project may apply for a funding extension of 1 internship unit (IU) per intern — to a maximum of 10 IUs per project. Applications for an extension can be submitted once the internship(s) being extended is/are at least 75% through their original timeline. The funding extension shall be used to: • Complete the existing project in cases where the project has experienced delays due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., lack of access to facilities due to COVID-19, sample delays due to transportation, seasonal delays in fieldwork, etc.) • Broaden the scope of the project (e.g., conducting additional tests, including additional samples, adding data sources for analysis, etc.) • In either case, the request cannot be used to add new objectives or change existing project objectives. 2.",
        "Extensions must be requested within 4 months from when the intern completed their last IU on the project. In cases where a new intern is being added to the project, the request must be submitted within 4 months from the end of the last IU completed on the project. 3. If the extensions will be used to add a new intern to the project, a New Intern Profile form and the new intern’s CV will be required along with this completed form. 4. All interns must remain eligible (including respecting maximum internship allocation) to hold Mitacs internships for the duration of the extension period. 5. No discounts or enhanced leveraging options are available to fund the extension internships. Only standard funding models may apply, regardless of the funding models for the original project. Partner organizations are required to contribute additional funds for the extension period. As the landscape around COVID-19 continues to change, our priority of supporting global public health remains steadfast.",
        "In response to these unprecedented times, Mitacs is making short-term modifications to our operations.Please let us know which option below best meets your needs during the pandemic period:A) Off-site: Mitacs is allowing work to take place virtually during this unprecedented time. In this case, we expect interns/fellows to follow partner and academic institution work from home procedures. We expect all participants to keep in close contact with each other, agreeing on expectations, and carrying out methodologies. Please confirm if this is the case.B) Changes: We are also supporting changes to projects on a case-by-case basis. If your project is not able to continue in the current climate (e.g., indispensable infrastructure isn’t available), you can put your project on hold at any time — now or in the future. If you wish to do this, we invite the academic researchers and the partner organizations to discuss the best course of action.",
        "Please advise us of the exact or anticipated dates on which your project was/will be put on hold and when it will be resumed.C) Other: If your project can carry on as originally planned, please let us know. If you need to make other modifications, please also let us know.For more information on how to get the most out of your virtual experience, we recommend you review the Virtual Interactions Guide found in the General Mitacs Terms, Conditions and Policies zip file under How To Apply. Or, refer to the Mitacs Virtual Interactions Resources online session on theEDGE portal. Mitacs Accelerate internships require the active participation of the intern, professor, and partner organization. All participants should attempt to fulfill their project obligations.If all parties are in agreement, a project or individual internship may be terminated.",
        "If one party wants to cancel the internship without other parties’ agreement, they must first notify them in writing and allow 30 days for resolution of outstanding issues.Any funds remaining after a cancelled internship must be returned to Mitacs. For more information, please refer to the downloadable General Mitacs Terms, Conditions & Policies zip file found under How To Apply. Participants should check their spam or junk folder. If they still haven’t received it, they should contact evaluation@mitacs.ca. The Mid-Term surveys are mid-term checks that are sent to Accelerate Interns & the partner organizations at the midpoint of each internship unit on the project, to check-in and ensure that the internship started as originally proposed, to address any issues, and to offer an opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback to the Accelerate team during the internship. Participants should receive an invitation within the 30 days following the completion of their internship/fellowship.",
