The program is creating over 2,000 new WIL opportunities, with wage subsidies up to $7,000 available to employers who offer work experience, co-op placements, internships, field placements or applied projects. WIL opportunities better position post-secondary students to secure employment in their field of study. While Gearing Up is open to all eligible students, the program also encourages participation by underrepresented groups such as women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, recent immigrants, first-year students and members of visible minority groups. Contact wagesubsidies@mihr.ca for more information. Online Application Form Publication Apply for a wage subsidy.
